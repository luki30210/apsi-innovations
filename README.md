### Running using the Maven Plugin

The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a `run` goal that can be used to quickly compile and run your application. Applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE. The following example shows a typical Maven command to run a Spring Boot application:
```
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

## frontend

This project was generated with [Angular 
CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4 (updated to 6.0.3).
